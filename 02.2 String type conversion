birth_year will take a string input(ex. "2002" as a string) but we can not subtract a string from a integer,
so we have to convert the string into integer, for that we have a builtin function in python library i.e -
data_type(string variable)
ex. year = int(birt_year) >> it will convert string "2002" to integer value 2002. now compiler can substract as formula says.
>>another  int()
           float()
           bool()
           str()

#currected code >>
birth_year = input("Enter your birth year")
current_year = 2024
age = current_year - int(birth_year)
print("currently you are",age,"old")

#output>>
Enter your birth year2002
currently you are 22 old
